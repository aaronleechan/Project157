# Project157

### Introduction
Our project application domain is a Movie website. 
There are a number of movies inside the database with related information, taken from imdb.com and cooked up ourselves. 
The website was created with HTML, CSS, PHP, MariaDB and a little JavaScript.
We are using XAMPP as our web server. 
The purpose of this movie database website is to help movie fans find information about movies. The website gives information such as rating, genre, actors, actress, directors, studio, etc.

### Features
The base of the website is the index4.php template given to us, although we added custom css styling. 
We also added some extra features:

1. Users can find detailed information about movies using key fields or a search bar. 
2. Users can add a new a new movie and its accompanying information to the database.
